    <h2 id="feed">Feeding</h2> 
    <ul>
      <li>Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health. The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten. Properly balanced foods will contain taurine.</li>
    
      <li>You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill your cat’s water bowls daily.</li>
      
      <li>Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting or lethargy continue for more than two days.</li>
    </ul>
      
      <h2 id="behave">Behavior</h2>
      
      <p>Discourage the cat from exploring forbidden surfaces. Cats are curious, and will jump on counters or other places you'd like them to steer clear of. Scat mats, a perfectly timed mist of water from a spray bottle, or even a stern “no” can correct this behavior. With time and patience, you can teach your cat to stay away from your protected areas. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can also use a rattle can (an empty soda can filled with a few pebbles and the opening taped over). Toss it gently on the ground to scare a cat away from forbidden surfaces. DO NOT throw the can at the cat, for that may harm your cat.</li>
        
      </ul>
           
    <h2 id="groom">Grooming</h2>
      
      <ul>
        
        <li>Most cats stay relatively clean and rarely need a bath, but you should brush or comb your cat regularly. Frequent brushing helps keep your cat's coat clean, reduces the amount of shedding and cuts down on the incidence of hairballs.</li>
        
      </ul>
        
    <h2 id="handle">Handling</h2>
      
      <p>When handling you cat the best way to pick them up is to place one hand behind the front legs and another infront of their hind legs. After placing your hands in the correct position, make sure to lift them up gently. Never pick up a cat by the scruff of the neck or by the front legs.</p>
  
    <h2 id="litter">Litter Box</h2>
      
      <p> Most cats will prefer the litter box to other parts of the house because of the texture of the litter. But, there are still steps you need to take to make sure you're offering the litter box as the best place to use the bathroom.</p>
      
    <ul>
        <li>Place the box in a quiet spot where the cat won’t be bothered by people, dogs, or loud noises.</li>
      
      <li>To keep the litter box clean, make sure you scoop the litter daily, and clean the box weekly. You should also replace or refresh the litter at least once a week.</li>
      
      <li>Provide enough litter boxes for more than one cat. If you have 2 cats, you need 3 litter boxes in different areas of the home. One cat might try to intimidate a less dominate cat away from using a single box.</li>
      
    </ul>
      
    <h2 id="scratch">Scratching</h2>
      
        <p>Cats need to scratch often, and when a cat needs to scratch their nails, they will turn to your sofas, carpets and beds unless you have some form of scratching post for them. When cats scratch their nails, the old outer nail sheath is pulled off and the sharp claws underneath are exposed. Cutting your cat’s nails every two to three weeks will help tremendously because it will keep them relatively blunt and less likely to harm the arms of both humans and furniture. Providing your cat with a sturdy scratching post, at least three feet high. The post should also be stable enough that it won't wobble during use, and should be covered with rough material such as sisal, burlap or tree bark. Many cats also like scratching pads.</p>
