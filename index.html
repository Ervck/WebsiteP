    <h2 id="feed">Feeding</h2> 
    
    <p>
You should choose a good brand of cat food, cheaper products may not provide enough nutrition to keep your cat happy and healthy. The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten. Like other animals, cats have some specific nutritional needs. They require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health. Asking your vet for suggestions about a good quality food is a great way to get started. As well you shoul avoid feeding your cat human foods unless you have cleared the food with your veterinarian. Some human foods can make a cat severely sick or are even toxic to cats (e.g., chocolate).</p>
      
   <p>      
New cat owners often time overfeed their cats as they do not know how to turn their cute meows down. You should follow your veterinarian's recommendations closely and make sure your cat gets plenty of exercise, as obesity is one of the biggest health issues facing cats today. Obese cats are more likely to develop diabetes when they approach middle age. Extra weight also contributes to arthritis, heart disease, and other health problems in cats.</p>
    
      
      <h2 id="behave">Behavior</h2>
      
      <p>Discourage the cat from exploring forbidden surfaces. Cats are curious, and will jump on every counter possible and other places you'd like them to steer clear of. Although a perfectly timed mist of water from a spray bottle, or even a stern “no” can correct this behavior. With time and patience, you can teach your cat to stay away from your protected areas. </p>
      
      <ul>  
        <li>You can also use a rattle can (an empty soda can filled with a few pebbles and the opening taped over). Toss it gently on the ground to scare a cat away from forbidden surfaces.</li>
      </ul>
           
    <h2 id="groom">Grooming</h2>
        
        <p>
          You may think that because cats seem to groom themselves, you don't need to brush them. But you especially need to brush long-hair cats several times a week and short-hair cats weekly. This will help reduce shedding in your home and also help the cat avoid hairballs.</p>
      
        <p>
        Additionally, when brushing your furry friend while your at it, try to look for skin conditions as you brush. Make sure to be on the lookout for any fleas or other parasites, and for any unusual redness, lumps, bumps, or other skin problems. If you see anything suspicious, let your veterinarian know as soon as possible and ask for advice on how you should take care of it.</p>
        
    <h2 id="handle">Handling</h2>
      
      <p>When handling you cat the best way to pick them up is to place one hand behind the front legs and another infront of their hind legs. After placing your hands in the correct position, make sure to lift them up gently. Never pick up a cat by the scruff of the neck or by the front legs.</p>
      
    
  
    <h2 id="litter">Litter Box</h2>
      
      <p> Most cats will prefer the litter box to other parts of the house because of the texture of the litter. But, there are still steps you need to take to make sure you're offering the litter box as the best place to use the bathroom.</p>
      
    <ul>
        <li>Place the box in a quiet spot where the cat won’t be bothered by people, dogs, or loud noises.</li>
      
      <li>To keep the litter box clean, make sure you scoop the litter daily, and clean the box weekly. You should also replace or refresh the litter at least once a week.</li>
      
      <li>Provide enough litter boxes for more than one cat. If you have 2 cats, you need 3 litter boxes in different areas of the home. One cat might try to intimidate a less dominate cat away from using a single box.</li>
      
    </ul>
      
    <h2 id="scratch">Scratching</h2>
      
        <p>Cats need to scratch often, and when a cat needs to scratch their nails, they will turn to your sofas, carpets and beds unless you have some form of scratching post for them. When cats scratch their nails, the old outer nail sheath is pulled off and the sharp claws underneath are exposed. Cutting your cat’s nails every two to three weeks will help tremendously because it will keep them relatively blunt and less likely to harm the arms of both humans and furniture. Providing your cat with a sturdy scratching post, at least three feet high. The post should also be stable enough that it won't wobble during use, and should be covered with rough material such as sisal, burlap or tree bark. Many cats also like scratching pads.</p>
      
      <h2 id="medical">Medical</h2>
      <p>
        Just like any member of the family, a cat needs regular medical visits. Unlike human children, cats can't let us know when they're not feeling well. They rely on their humans to take them to a veterinarian for regular medical examinations to keep them healthy. As cats often times show no signs of being unwell, it extremely important that a cat sees a vet at least once a year, for a physical check-up: teeth, ears, eyes, heart, booster vaccinations, and deflea/deworm treatments. All cat owners should consider getting their pet vaccinated against the following: feline infectious enteritis (FIE), cat ‘flu and feline leukemia virus (FeLV). All can kill cats if they become infected and so it is important to protect your pet. You may also find that a cattery will not accept your pet, should you need their services, without proof of these and potentially other vaccinations. Your vet can advise exactly what vaccinations are required for your pet. If you are at all concerned about your cat’s health or behaviour you should see your vet as soon as possible.</p>
      
      <h2 id="health">Health</h2>
      <p>Furthermore, your cats hygiene is also very important for their health. Get the cat used to tooth brushing. Cats can and do suffer from dental disease. To brush your cat's teeth, you need a soft-bristled toothbrush and veterinary toothpaste. Never use human toothpaste — too much fluoride can upset your cat's stomach, and with the high fluoride concentration in human toothpaste, too much could be toxic. Start by offering him/her a taste of the veterinary toothpaste. The next time, let him/her taste the toothpaste, and then run your finger along the gums of the upper teeth. Repeat the process with the toothbrush. Get the bristles of the brush along the gum line of the upper back teeth and angle slightly up, so the bristles get under the gum line. Work from back to front, making small circles along the gum lines. It should take you less than 30 seconds to brush your pet's teeth. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not try to brush the entire mouth at first. If he/she only lets you brush the outside of her upper teeth, it's better than nothing. You're still addressing the most important area of dental disease prevention.</li>
        
        <h3>Playing</h3>
        <p>Make sure your cat gets enough play time. Your cat needs interaction with you daily to keep him/her both emotionally happy and physically fit. Use cat toys, talking, and grooming as chances to spend time together. Laser pointers, balls, play mice, and feather toys are also good ways to engage your cat in play. </p>
