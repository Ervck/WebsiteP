<h1>Momo the Cat</h1>

<p>Momo was my first cat so I wanted to make a page dedicated to him because I figured it would be a fun project doing so. </p>

<!-- I havent found a suitable picture yet, sorry. -->
<p>Heâ€™s pretty cute right?</p>

<!-- I plan on having it lead to more images of him because I figured it would be a more fun way to show more of him instead of a collage,I also havent decided on these either.-->
